# Make-Books
Script that turns public domain txt files into PDFs. Project Gutenberg is a great place to look to get started

### How to Use
Currently, upon running the script, it will ask for a title, author, and filename. Enter the filename of the txt file to be converted and it will create a PDF version.

For example, try this with the included txt file:

    ruby make_books.rb
    Title: Persuasion
    Author: Jane Austen
    File: persuasion2.txt
  
And boom - you have a PDF version of Persuasion.
